Bouncy truck is a game that I made with two other group members for our final project in ICS 111. It was a beginner level class where we learned to use Java by developing small games and building up to combine concepts that we were learning in class. We used a program called eclipse to code in Java. The game was made with pictures and sprites that move from right to left across the screen. The goal of the game was to get as high of a score as possible without dying. 

This project helped me a lot in communicating and working together to develop the game. We each had our own section of code to finish and we looked over each others code when we were done. The game is very simple but creating this game me an experience into what it is like to work together to make something with code. I had recorded a small video of a demonstration of the game along with showing some of the coding. [Youtube](https://youtu.be/7IyUuMywj9Q)
