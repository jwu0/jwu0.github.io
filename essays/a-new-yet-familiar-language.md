## Beginning FreeCodeCamp
JavaScript is like revisiting an old game and seeing the differences. It is much more different than languages like C and C++. It was much harder to learn those languages because I didn't have any resources to make it easier to learn. JavaScript was much easier to learn than those two languages since its similar to Java but also because of FreeCodeCamp. FreeCodeCamp was a great way to learn the basics of JavaScript. The ES6 section in FreeCodeCamp was also very helpful in showing the extra features of JavaScript. 

## Familiarity
I think that JavaScript is a decent programming language for a software engineering. Since I knew Java before learning JavaScript, the syntax felt very familiar and I was able to get the hang of it relatively quickly. Something that I really like about JavaScript is declaring variables and passing parameters. There are no specific data types when declaring a variable or passing a parameter. It makes things much more convienent when building the function without a proper plan. 

## WODs
The "WODs", or workout of the day, are very helpful in practicing using JavaScript from a practical standpoint. It simulates a problem that I have to solve and code within a certain amount of time much like coding interviews for jobs. This also helps me to understand more of the content and syntax of JavaScript. I really enjoy doing the WODs even if I am not able to complete it in the alloted time. Each time we do it, it's a learning experience for me and will help me learn to work with another person to code something.

## Looking Forward
All in all, JavaScript is a language that I thought was very easy to get into due to knowing the syntax of Java prior. It is still a new language and there is a lot more to know about it. The WODs are a great help in assisting me with learning this language. So I look forward to being able to learn more about it and add JavaScript to my arsenal!
